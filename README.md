# Special school management website

Current contents - currently i've added the login page for your reference. There are some stuff excluded in this folder so dont expect it to magically work by cloning it (This is because of the existence of the .gitignore file)
But once you've set up node js and created an app using node you'l get an idea of the file structure based on the file structure created locally you can kinda cross compare and identify what i've done.

## Things you should copy to your landing page
The animated background should be the same through out, we work in containers the actual content should be in the containers the containers are what you should play around with.
